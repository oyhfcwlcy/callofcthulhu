# CallofCthulhu(7thEd.) System  
This system is based [Boilerplate System](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/foundryvtt-system-tutorial/-/blob/master/pages/01-getting-started.md) @ Asacolips.  
And we built the scaffolding for the system using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/).  
This is a system for the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com).  
This game does not provide a rulebook or other data in accordance with  
Chaosium [Fan-Use and Licensing](https://www.chaosium.com/fan-use-and-licensing-q-a/).  
(The data used is limited to Free Quick-Start.)  
This is a game to be played with a rulebook in hand.


# Install  
It is described in Foundry Virtual Tabletop by reading system.josn written in the URL  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tadaimatrpg/callofcthulhu/master/system.json  
or putting it in the system file.  

# About specifications and game system  
This system assumes you have a rulebook.  
The system is made very simple, and as anyone who has played Call of Cthulhu for  
many years knows,this game is very easy to lose.  
In the campaign being sold on Chaosium, the Shadows of Yog-Sothoth scenario loses over 10 character sheets.  
And while out of print in Japan, "黄昏の天使" has over 20 lost character sheets.  
For this reason, this system uses the text method.  
Enter only the status you need in 7thED, and then add your skills by rolling a die on  
Open the JournalEntry "template" in the Compendium and the "Character sheet template".  
Just copy and paste it into the character sheet.  
This system is different from other systems, and as I mentioned earlier, it is simple.  
It's all about making sure you have no problems using any of the supplements.  
You just need to add the necessary skills, etc., in the text.  
When doing combat, it refers to DEX, which can be notated by making a die roll.
The VEHICLE that comes up in character selection can be used in a variety of ways,  
including as an obstacle,  
vehicle, or even as a MAP piece for use in the campaign.  
As stated in 7thED, KP is free to play the game. That's why this system is so 
simple and allows you to create characters right away and be free to do whatever you want.

# Author's Boring Thoughts  
Playing Call of Cthulhu is a horrible game that asks for immorality and commits blasphemy.  
However, I like this game very much.  
It's important for everyone to enjoy playing the game.
